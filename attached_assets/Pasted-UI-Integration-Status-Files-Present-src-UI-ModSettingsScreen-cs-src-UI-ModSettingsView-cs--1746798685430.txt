UI Integration Status:
✅ Files Present:

/src/UI/ModSettingsScreen.cs

/src/UI/ModSettingsView.cs

/src/UI/ModSettingsViewModel.cs

/src/UI/SettingsBehavior.cs

/UI/Components/NumericBox.cs

⚠️ Concerns:

Missing XAML/Gauntlet UI XML files that define UI layouts.

UI relies on TaleWorlds.GauntletUI.ViewModel — but this namespace is stubbed in /stubs/ → this means no real GauntletUI implementation is linked!

I didn’t see .xml or .xsd UI files like UI/Prefabs/*.xml that Bannerlord Gauntlet UI usually needs.

The ViewModel class in /stubs/TaleWorlds/GauntletUI/ViewModel.cs is likely a placeholder → the game won’t recognize it in real execution.

➡️ Why UI isn’t showing:

Without valid Gauntlet UI bindings and no prefab xml definitions, the UI won’t render in-game.

No registration of ModSettingsView in SubModule.cs found.

🔧 Recommended:
✅ Add proper .xml prefab for UI layouts.
✅ Reference TaleWorlds.GauntletUI.ViewModel from real Bannerlord DLL instead of stubs.
✅ Ensure UI layer injection in SubModule.OnGameStart().

📝 2️⃣ AI Integration Status:
✅ AICommander implemented in /src/AICommander.cs
✅ AIService implemented
✅ BattleController implemented
✅ FallbackService implemented

⚠️ Issues:

AICommander.MakeDecision() and AIService.ProcessBattleSnapshot() have 0 external references → nothing is triggering them.

BattleUpdatePatch.cs exists but not clear if it’s being patched by Harmony at runtime.

➡️ Likely: no runtime hook is invoking the AI pipeline.

🔧 Recommended:
✅ Confirm Harmony patches in SubModule.cs.
✅ Validate whether BattleUpdatePatch.Apply() is being called.
✅ Verify if MissionBehavior hooks into OnMissionTick or similar game loop.

📝 3️⃣ Memory System (CommanderMemoryService):
✅ File exists
✅ Has basic fields & methods

⚠️ Issues:

Methods like RememberDecision & GetMemory → no external calls detected (0 references).

Memory state not persisted to file/database.

➡️ Currently unused in live AI pipeline.

🔧 Recommended:
✅ Add integration in AIService → log decisions via CommanderMemoryService.RememberDecision().
✅ Create load/save logic to persist memory per campaign.
✅ Connect to ModConfig toggles for enabling/disabling.

📝 4️⃣ References / Missing Dependencies:
✅ Found libraries /lib/ (TaleWorlds.*.dll are present)
✅ Harmony/Json.NET packaged
⚠️ BUT:

/stubs/ files like Vec3.cs, ViewModel.cs, FormationOrder.cs → being used instead of actual TaleWorlds.* DLL types.

Any call to Vec3/ViewModel/FormationOrder from these stubs won’t work in Bannerlord engine at runtime → they’re dummy files.

➡️ This is a critical issue:
→ Code compiles because stubs exist, but those types don’t link to engine internals → null or empty behavior in-game.

🔧 Recommended:
✅ Remove /stubs/ from project reference path.
✅ Reference real TaleWorlds.*.dll (already found in /lib/ folder).
✅ Ensure Visual Studio/Replit project uses /lib/ DLLs for resolving types.

🚩 ❓ Why is it failing in-game?
→ UI isn’t registered, missing prefabs, no ViewModel binding.
→ AI core isn’t connected to mission/game loop (no trigger points calling AI logic).
→ Memory system not integrated or invoked.
→ Stub files masking missing true engine references → → compiles but non-functional runtime.

🏗️ Summary Next Steps:
✅ Connect UI in SubModule.cs with GauntletLayer and prefab loading.
✅ Replace stub references → link to /lib/ DLLs.
✅ Wire AIService & BattleController into game events (MissionBehavior, Harmony patch or MBSubModuleBase overrides).
✅ Integrate CommanderMemoryService call chain.
✅ Confirm ModSettingsViewModel uses valid Gauntlet ViewModel inheritance.
