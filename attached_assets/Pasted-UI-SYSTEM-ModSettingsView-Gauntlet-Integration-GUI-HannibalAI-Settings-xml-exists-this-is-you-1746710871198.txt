UI SYSTEM (ModSettingsView, Gauntlet Integration)
✅ GUI/HannibalAI_Settings.xml exists → this is your XML for UI.

❌ Missing ModSettingsView.cs in the codebase directory.
I couldn’t locate UI/ModSettingsView.cs in the extracted files. This is critical because the error you had earlier was due to missing references to TaleWorlds.Engine.GauntletUI, GauntletLayer, etc.

👉 Likely cause why UI doesn’t show in-game:

ModSettingsView.cs might have not been properly committed to Git or was overwritten.

GUI/HannibalAI_Settings.xml is present but no C# code is loading it.

No registration of GauntletLayer or injection of UI view model in SubModule.

✅ Found SubModule.xml and it references HannibalAI.dll → that part is fine.

🔍 FIXES REQUIRED:
✅ Ensure ModSettingsView.cs is in /UI/ and fully implemented.
✅ In SubModule.cs, check if Loading or OnMissionBehaviorInitialize adds the Gauntlet layer.
✅ Verify that ViewModel is created and bound to XML.

📝 2️⃣ MEMORY SYSTEM (CommanderMemoryService.cs)
✅ CommanderMemoryService.cs exists in /Services/.

✅ Contains methods for GetMemory, StoreMemory.

❌ No calls or references found in AICommander or BattleController or AIService.

👉 Likely cause why it isn’t storing/using memory:

Methods are implemented but no other class is actually calling them → so memory isn’t written or retrieved.

🔍 FIXES REQUIRED:
✅ Add hooks in AICommander.MakeDecision or AIService.ProcessBattleSnapshot to call StoreMemory and GetMemory.
✅ Consider passing formationId or commanderId to memory functions.
✅ Add logging in StoreMemory/GetMemory to validate when they trigger.

📝 3️⃣ AI INTEGRATION (AICommander, AIService, FallbackService)
✅ AICommander.cs → exists in /Battle/ with MoveFormation, ChangeFormation, FlankEnemy, etc.

✅ AIService.cs → exists in /Services/ with ProcessBattleSnapshot defined.

✅ FallbackService.cs → exists in /Services/ with GetFallbackDecision.

🚩 AICommander.MakeDecision() has 0 references in scan → nothing is calling it → AI isn’t being triggered!

🚩 AIService.ProcessBattleSnapshot() only called inside itself → no other class triggers it.

👉 Likely cause AI isn’t executing:

SubModule.cs or BattleController isn’t calling these service methods during mission.

🔍 FIXES REQUIRED:
✅ Add call in MissionBehavior.OnMissionTick() (or equivalent) to call AIService.ProcessBattleSnapshot.
✅ From there, chain AICommander.MakeDecision → BattleController.ExecuteAIDecision.
✅ Validate that ExecuteAIDecision triggers actual in-game formation commands.
